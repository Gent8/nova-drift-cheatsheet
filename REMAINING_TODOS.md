---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Recognition Engine Layout Discovery

### Major Architectural Issue Identified
**Problem**: Current recognition engine assumes uniform hexagonal grid, but Nova Drift has **two-zone layout**:

**Actual Nova Drift Layout** (from real game analysis):
```
x x|  <- Body, Shield, Weapon (triangular offset positioning)
 x    <- Core upgrades NOT in straight line
      <- Clear gap/space separation
xxxx  <- Dense 4-wide hexagonal grid
xxxx  <- All other mods in honeycomb pattern
xxxx  <- Perfectly aligned mathematical grid
xxxx
xxxx
xxxx
```

**Key Layout Details:**
- **Core Zone**: 3 upgrades (Body/Shield/Weapon) in triangular/offset arrangement at top
- **Separation Gap**: Clear vertical space between core and regular zones  
- **Regular Zone**: Dense 4-wide hexagonal grid in perfect honeycomb pattern
- **Grid Width**: Regular mods arranged in consistent 4-hexagon-wide rows
- **Alignment**: Core upgrades use offset positioning, regular grid uses mathematical alignment

### Critical Priority - Must Fix Before Phase 1
- [ ] **URGENT: Redesign Grid Mapping System** - Current system assumes uniform grid but Nova Drift has two distinct zones
  - **Current flaw**: `grid-mapper.js` uses mathematical hexagonal grid assumptions for entire area
  - **Reality**: Core upgrades use triangular offset positioning (3 specific positions), regular grid is 4-wide honeycomb
  - **Specific issue**: Core zone coordinates can't be calculated mathematically - require position templates
  - **Impact**: Recognition accuracy will be severely compromised (0% for core upgrades, poor for regular grid boundary detection)
  - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocks Phase 1 recognition integration

- [ ] **Update Recognition Engine Architecture** - Implement two-zone recognition system
  - **Zone 1**: Core upgrades (3 fixed positions in triangular arrangement) - template-based recognition
  - **Zone 2**: Regular mod grid (4-wide honeycomb, mathematical coordinates) - grid-based recognition  
  - **Zone Detection**: Identify horizontal separation gap between core and regular zones
  - **Coordinate Systems**: Dual approach - position templates for core, axial coordinates for regular grid
  - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Core feature requirement

- [ ] **Redesign Coordinate System** - Handle dual layout approach  
  - **Core Zone**: 3 hardcoded position templates (Body: top-left, Shield: top-right, Weapon: center-offset)
  - **Regular Zone**: 4-wide hexagonal axial coordinate system (q,r mapping)
  - **Boundary Detection**: Horizontal gap detection algorithm to separate zones
  - **Scaling**: Both zones must scale consistently with UI scaling and resolution
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Required for accurate recognition

### Files Requiring Major Updates
- `docs/grid-mapper.js` - Complete redesign for two-zone system (core templates + 4-wide grid math)
- `docs/recognition-engine/recognition-engine.js` - Zone-aware processing with dual coordinate systems
- `docs/recognition-engine/pattern-matcher.js` - Separate algorithms for template matching vs grid mapping
- Phase 1 planning documents - Update recognition integration approach to handle dual zones
- New: Core upgrade position templates (Body/Shield/Weapon specific pixel positions)
- New: Zone boundary detection algorithm (gap detection between core and regular zones)

### Impact Assessment
- **ROI Detection**: ✅ No impact - algorithms detect overall build area correctly
- **Recognition Engine**: ❌ Major impact - current design fundamentally flawed
- **Phase 0 Completion**: ✅ Can proceed with ROI validation
- **Phase 1 Timeline**: ⚠️ Add 1-2 weeks for recognition engine redesign
