## ✅ RESOLVED: Recognition Engine Layout Discovery

### Major Architectural Issue - NOW RESOLVED
**Problem**: ✅ RESOLVED - Recognition engine now properly handles Nova Drift's **two-zone layout**:

**Actual Nova Drift Layout** (from real game analysis):
```
x x|  <- Body, Shield, Weapon (triangular offset positioning)
 x    <- Core upgrades NOT in straight line
      <- Clear gap/space separation
xxxx  <- Dense 4-wide hexagonal grid
xxxx  <- All other mods in honeycomb pattern
xxxx  <- Perfectly aligned mathematical grid
xxxx
xxxx
xxxx
```

**Key Layout Details:**
- **Core Zone**: 3 upgrades (Body/Shield/Weapon) in triangular/offset arrangement at top
- **Separation Gap**: Clear vertical space between core and regular zones  
- **Regular Zone**: Dense 4-wide hexagonal grid in perfect honeycomb pattern
- **Grid Width**: Regular mods arranged in consistent 4-hexagon-wide rows
- **Alignment**: Core upgrades use offset positioning, regular grid uses mathematical alignment

### Critical Priority - Must Fix Before Phase 1
