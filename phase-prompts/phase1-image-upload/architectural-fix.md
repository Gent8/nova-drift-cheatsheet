I need you to analyze and fix critical architectural issues in Phase 1 of my Nova Drift screenshot recognition system.

STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND THE SPECIFICATION:
First, read implementation/Phase1-ImageUpload.md to understand the detailed architectural requirements, including:
- Required modular structure (separate files for upload-handler, validator, progress-indicator)
- Expected OOP design with specific classes (ScreenshotUploadHandler, UploadValidator, ProgressIndicator)
- Structured error handling system with error codes and user action guidance
- Performance requirements and memory management

STEP 2 - ANALYZE THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
Examine the actual implementation in the codebase:
- docs/upload-feature.js (monolithic 424-line file)
- docs/index.html (upload UI integration)
- docs/style.css (upload styling)
- docs/upload-tests.js (testing implementation)

STEP 3 - IDENTIFY THE ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEMS:
Compare what was implemented vs what was specified. Key issues:
- Monolithic structure instead of modular design
- Functional programming approach instead of required OOP classes
- Simple string error messages instead of structured error objects
- Missing proper module separation and interfaces
- Potential memory leaks from canvas cleanup

STEP 4 - IMPLEMENT THE ARCHITECTURAL FIX:
Refactor Phase 1 to match the specification:
- Create docs/modules/ directory structure
- Split upload-feature.js into separate modular files:
  - docs/modules/upload-handler.js (ScreenshotUploadHandler class)
  - docs/modules/upload-validator.js (UploadValidator class) 
  - docs/modules/progress-indicator.js (ProgressIndicator class)
- Implement structured error handling with codes and actions
- Add proper memory management and canvas cleanup
- Maintain all existing functionality and UI integration
- Ensure Phase 2 integration points remain intact

STEP 5 - PRESERVE FUNCTIONALITY:
Critical requirements:
- Keep existing event system (screenshot-ready event with same data structure)
- Maintain UI integration and accessibility features
- Preserve all testing capabilities
- Ensure no regression in user experience
- Keep performance characteristics

STEP 6 - UPDATE INTEGRATION:
- Update docs/index.html to load modular files instead of monolithic file
- Ensure proper initialization order
- Maintain public API for testing and future phases
- Update tests to work with new modular structure

STEP 7 - VALIDATE THE FIX:
- Run existing tests to ensure no functional regression
- Test upload functionality manually
- Verify event system still works for Phase 2 integration
- Check memory usage improvements
- Validate accessibility and responsive design

REQUIREMENTS:
- Follow the exact specification in implementation/Phase1-ImageUpload.md
- Maintain backward compatibility for Phase 2 integration
- Improve code maintainability and extensibility
- Fix memory management issues
- Preserve all user-facing functionality

The goal is to transform the working but architecturally problematic implementation into a clean, modular, specification-compliant foundation for the remaining phases.
