I need to implement a screenshot-based preset recognition system for my Nova Drift cheatsheet.

Please read prompts/README.md to understand the overall approach, then implement Phase 8 according to prompts/08-phase8-documentation.md.

Focus on the success criteria and ensure all testing requirements are met. IMPORTANT: You must verify that all success criteria are actually achieved by running unit tests in the terminal - do not assume success without terminal-based verification. This is the final phase.
