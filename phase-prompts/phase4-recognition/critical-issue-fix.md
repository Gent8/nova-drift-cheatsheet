I need you to analyze and fix a critical architectural issue in Phase 4 of my Nova Drift screenshot recognition system.

STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND THE PLAN:
First, read implementation/Phase4-Recognition.md to understand what Phase 4 was supposed to accomplish according to the original specification.

STEP 2 - ANALYZE THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
Then examine the actual implementation in the codebase:
- docs/recognition-engine/ (all files)
- docs/recognition-integration.js
- docs/test-phase4.js and docs/test-phase4-validation.js

STEP 3 - UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING SYSTEM:
Critically important - examine how the current Nova Drift cheatsheet actually works:
- docs/main.js (selection system using 'checked' attributes)
- docs/hex.css (sprite sheet references)
- docs/hex.png (actual game mod sprites)
- docs/style.css (brightness filter system for selected/unselected states)

STEP 4 - IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL ISSUE:
Compare what Phase 4 currently does vs what it should do based on the existing system architecture. The issue involves a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem domain.

STEP 5 - EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM:
Clearly articulate:
- What Phase 4 currently tries to detect
- What it should actually detect
- Why the current approach won't work with the existing system
- How the existing selection system already works

STEP 6 - IMPLEMENT THE FIX:
Refactor Phase 4 to:
- Focus on MOD IDENTIFICATION instead of selection state detection
- Use the actual hex.png sprite sheet as reference templates
- Output mod identifications that can integrate with the existing DOM-based selection system
- Maintain the solid architectural foundation (multi-algorithm approach, consensus engine, etc.)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep the existing event-driven architecture
- Maintain performance monitoring and error handling
- Ensure Phase 5 can receive proper mod identification data
- Run tests to verify the fix works
- Document the changes made

Focus on fixing the core problem: Phase 4 should identify WHICH MODS are in the screenshot, not whether they appear selected or unselected in the screenshot.
