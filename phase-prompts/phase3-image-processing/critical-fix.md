I need you to analyze and fix critical implementation issues in Phase 3 of my Nova Drift screenshot recognition system.

STEP 1 - UNDERSTAND THE SPECIFICATION:
First, read implementation/Phase3-ImageProcessing.md to understand what Phase 3 was supposed to accomplish according to the original specification, including:
- True Web Worker implementation for parallel processing
- Adaptive image enhancement that doesn't over-process
- Accurate memory usage tracking
- Proper hexagonal masking with pixel-perfect accuracy
- Quality thresholds that adapt to screenshot characteristics

STEP 2 - ANALYZE THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
Examine the actual implementation in the codebase:
- docs/image-processing/image-processor.js (main orchestrator - 253 lines)
- docs/image-processing/region-extractor.js (region extraction logic - 379 lines)
- docs/image-processing/quality-analyzer.js (quality assessment - 375 lines)
- docs/image-processing/memory-manager.js (resource management - 282 lines)
- docs/image-processing/worker-pool.js (parallel processing - 280 lines)
- docs/image-processing/processing-utils.js (utilities - 433 lines)
- docs/image-processing-integration.js (Phase 2 integration)
- docs/test-phase3.js (comprehensive test suite - 557 lines)

STEP 3 - IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL PROBLEMS:
Based on the code review analysis, the main issues are:

**PROBLEM 1 - Fake Worker Pool Implementation:**
- WorkerPool class is currently a synchronous fallback instead of true Web Worker usage
- No actual Web Worker scripts are created or loaded
- Processing still happens on main thread, could block UI during heavy processing
- Workers are "initialized" but never actually spawn background threads

**PROBLEM 2 - Over-Aggressive Image Enhancement:**
- Multiple enhancement steps applied sequentially without quality assessment
- Enhancement pipeline may introduce artifacts that hurt recognition accuracy
- No toggle for enhancement intensity based on original image quality
- Fixed contrast enhancement (1.1x) may not be appropriate for all screenshots

**PROBLEM 3 - Inaccurate Memory Usage Tracking:**
- Memory calculation only accounts for canvas pooling, not actual browser memory
- ImageData objects and temporary processing buffers not tracked
- performance.memory API not properly integrated for real usage monitoring
- May give false confidence about memory usage in production

**PROBLEM 4 - Rigid Quality Thresholding:**
- Fixed quality threshold (0.7) may be too restrictive for varying screenshot quality
- No adaptive thresholding based on overall image characteristics
- Hard failure rather than graceful degradation for low-quality regions
- May reject too many valid regions in poor lighting or compression scenarios

**PROBLEM 5 - Hexagonal Mask Mathematical Issues:**
- Hexagonal distance formula appears incorrect for pixel-space detection
- May not match actual hex shapes in Nova Drift screenshots
- Could exclude valid pixels or include unwanted background pixels
- Needs proper pixel-based polygon intersection testing

STEP 4 - IMPLEMENT TRUE WEB WORKER SUPPORT:
Fix the worker pool by:
- Creating actual Web Worker script files in docs/workers/ directory
- Implementing proper worker task distribution for CPU-intensive operations
- Adding worker communication protocols with error handling
- Maintaining fallback to synchronous processing when workers unavailable
- Moving image filtering, quality analysis, and enhancement to background threads

STEP 5 - FIX IMAGE ENHANCEMENT PIPELINE:
Improve the enhancement system by:
- Making enhancement optional and adaptive based on input quality assessment
- Implementing quality-aware enhancement that only processes when beneficial
- Adding configurable enhancement intensity levels
- Creating bypass mechanisms for already high-quality images
- Separating enhancement from core extraction functionality

STEP 6 - IMPLEMENT ACCURATE MEMORY MONITORING:
Enhance memory management by:
- Integrating performance.memory API for real browser memory tracking
- Adding memory usage tracking for ImageData objects and processing buffers
- Implementing memory pressure detection and response mechanisms
- Creating accurate memory reporting for debugging and optimization
- Adding memory leak detection for long-running processing sessions

STEP 7 - ADD ADAPTIVE QUALITY THRESHOLDS:
Improve quality assessment by:
- Implementing dynamic quality thresholds based on overall screenshot quality
- Adding confidence-based processing that gracefully degrades with poor quality
- Creating quality distribution analysis across all extracted regions
- Implementing quality-aware batch processing strategies
- Adding user feedback integration for threshold calibration

STEP 8 - FIX HEXAGONAL MASKING:
Correct the geometric calculations by:
- Implementing proper pixel-based polygon intersection testing
- Using accurate hexagon vertex calculations for masking
- Adding visual debugging tools to verify mask accuracy
- Creating test cases with known hex shapes to validate masking
- Ensuring masks match actual Nova Drift hex boundaries

STEP 9 - PRESERVE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY:
Critical requirements:
- Keep existing event system (regions-extracted event with same data structure)
- Maintain all test coverage and ensure 100% pass rate continues
- Preserve performance characteristics (processing time must stay under targets)
- Keep UI integration and Phase 4 compatibility intact
- Maintain memory efficiency while improving accuracy

STEP 10 - VALIDATE THE FIXES:
- Run existing test suite to ensure no functional regression
- Add new tests for worker functionality, adaptive enhancement, and accurate memory tracking
- Verify processing performance still meets requirements (<3s for 4K screenshots)
- Test with various quality screenshots to validate adaptive thresholds
- Check memory usage accuracy with performance.memory API integration

REQUIREMENTS:
- Follow the exact architectural patterns from implementation/Phase3-ImageProcessing.md
- Maintain backward compatibility with Phase 2 integration
- Ensure forward compatibility with Phase 4 recognition system
- Fix identified issues without breaking existing functionality
- Improve real-world robustness and production readiness
- Keep comprehensive test coverage and documentation

The goal is to transform the working but architecturally flawed implementation into a truly robust, production-ready image processing system that handles real-world screenshot variations effectively while maintaining excellent performance.
