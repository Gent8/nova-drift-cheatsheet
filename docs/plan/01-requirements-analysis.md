## Overview
This document analyzes the requirements for implementing the Screenshot Build Import Assistant feature, incorporating insights from similar successful projects and identifying technical constraints, dependencies, and key implementation considerations based on proven approaches in web-based computer vision.

## Core Requirements Analysis

### 1. Functional Requirements

#### 1.1 Screenshot Processing
- **Input**: Screenshots from Nova Drift pause menus
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG
- **Resolution Handling**: Must support various screen resolutions
- **Processing Types**:
  - Perfectly cropped upgrade area
  - Fullscreen with upgrades on left side

#### 1.2 Recognition Requirements
- **Target Elements**: Hexagonal upgrade icons
- **Recognition Areas**:
  - Core Upgrades (3 hexagons): Weapon, Body, Shield
  - Mod Group: Regular mods, super mods, wild mods
- **Accuracy Target**: >75% raw recognition, >95% after user review

#### 1.3 User Interaction Flow
1. Upload screenshot via button click
2. Automatic/manual crop adjustment
3. Recognition processing with progress indication
4. Review mode with confidence flagging
5. Visual correction interface for low-confidence matches
6. Completion confirmation

### 2. Technical Constraints

#### 2.1 Static Site Limitations
- **No Server Processing**: All operations must be client-side
- **No Database**: Must use browser storage (IndexedDB)
- **No API Calls**: Cannot rely on external services
- **File Size**: Keep JavaScript bundles reasonable for GitHub Pages

#### 2.2 Browser Compatibility
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

#### 2.3 Performance Requirements
- Upload to completion: <20 seconds
- Responsive UI during processing
- Memory-efficient image handling

### 3. Data Requirements

#### 3.1 Existing Assets
- **hex.png**: CSS sprite sheet containing all upgrade icons
- **Upgrade Data**: Existing JSON/JavaScript data structure with upgrade metadata
- **Selection State**: Current checkbox-based selection system

#### 3.2 New Data Structures
- Template image database for matching
- Confidence thresholds configuration
- User correction history
- Session feedback data

### 4. Integration Points

#### 4.1 Cheatsheet Integration
- Reuse existing upgrade selection mechanism
- Maintain current URL state management
- Preserve existing UI/UX patterns

#### 4.2 Storage Integration
- IndexedDB for correction history
- LocalStorage for user preferences
- Session storage for temporary data

## Technical Dependencies

### 1. Core Libraries
