## Phase Template (Copy & Paste for Each Phase)

```
I need to implement a screenshot-based preset recognition system for my Nova Drift cheatsheet.

Please read prompts/README.md to understand the overall approach, then implement Phase [PHASE_NUMBER] according to prompts/[PHASE_FILE].md.

Focus on the success criteria and ensure all testing requirements are met before we proceed to Phase [NEXT_PHASE_NUMBER].

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the appropriate phase command** from the section above
2. **Paste it into your AI conversation** to start that phase
3. **Wait for completion** of all success criteria before moving to next phase
4. **Test thoroughly** after each phase implementation

## Phase Sequence

Execute in this order:
1. Phase 1: Image Upload & UX
2. Phase 2: Hex Grid Mapping  
3. Phase 3: Image Processing
4. Phase 4: Recognition Logic
5. Phase 5: System Integration
6. Phase 6: User Feedback
7. Phase 7: Testing & Calibration
8. Phase 8: Documentation

## Quick Reference

- **Project Type:** Haxe-based web application with JavaScript output
- **Architecture:** Client-side only, no external dependencies
