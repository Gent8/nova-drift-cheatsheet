## Phase Template (Copy & Paste for Each Phase)

```
I need to implement a screenshot-based preset recognition system for my Nova Drift cheatsheet.

Please read prompts/README.md to understand the overall approach, then implement Phase [PHASE_NUMBER] according to prompts/[PHASE_FILE].md.

Focus on the success criteria and ensure all testing requirements are met. IMPORTANT: You must verify that all success criteria are actually achieved by running unit tests in the terminal - do not assume success without terminal-based verification. Only proceed to Phase [NEXT_PHASE_NUMBER] after confirming all tests pass.
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the appropriate phase command** from the section above
2. **Paste it into your AI conversation** to start that phase
3. **Ensure the agent runs unit tests** to verify all success criteria are met
4. **Check terminal output** to confirm tests pass before proceeding
5. **Wait for completion** of all success criteria before moving to next phase
6. **Test thoroughly** after each phase implementation

⚠️ **Critical**: Do not proceed to the next phase unless the agent has run terminal-based unit tests that verify all success criteria. Agents can easily read terminal output but may miss issues in HTML modules or other non-terminal outputs.

## Phase Sequence

Execute in this order:
1. Phase 1: Image Upload & UX
2. Phase 2: Hex Grid Mapping  
3. Phase 3: Image Processing
4. Phase 4: Recognition Logic
5. Phase 5: System Integration
6. Phase 6: User Feedback
7. Phase 7: Testing & Calibration
8. Phase 8: Documentation

## Quick Reference

- **Project Type:** Haxe-based web application with JavaScript output
- **Architecture:** Client-side only, no external dependencies
- **Integration:** Must work with existing Nova Drift cheatsheet UI
- **Success Metrics:** >90% accuracy, <2s processing, <50KB payload, <100MB memory
