# Phase 1: Image Upload & User Experience Implementation

## 🎯 Mission
Implement a user-friendly file upload interface that allows users to upload screenshots of their Nova Drift mod selection screen. This interface must integrate seamlessly with the existing cheatsheet UI while providing robust file validation and user feedback.

## 📚 Required Reading
**Before starting, read these files to understand the context:**
1. `../implementation/README.md` - Overall architecture and technical approach
2. `../implementation/Phase1-ImageUpload.md` - Detailed Phase 1 specifications
3. `../docs/index.html` - Existing UI structure to integrate with
4. `../docs/style.css` - Current styling patterns to follow

## 🎯 Success Criteria
You must achieve ALL of these before Phase 1 is considered complete:

- ✅ Users can upload PNG/JPG files via click or drag-and-drop
- ✅ File validation prevents invalid uploads with clear error messages
- ✅ Upload progress indication for larger files
- ✅ Integration with existing toolbar UI without layout disruption
- ✅ Accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly touch interface
- ✅ Error recovery with helpful user guidance

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### File Constraints
```javascript
const FILE_CONSTRAINTS = {
  maxSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024,      // 10MB maximum
  minSize: 1024,                   // 1KB minimum
  allowedTypes: ['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg'],
  maxDimensions: { width: 4096, height: 4096 },
  minDimensions: { width: 300, height: 200 }
};
```

### Browser Support Requirements
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 90+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Native File API, Drag & Drop API, Canvas API support
- Progressive enhancement (works without advanced features)

## 🎨 UI Integration Points

### Existing Elements to Work With
- **Toolbar area**: Insert upload button in existing toolbar
- **Main content area**: Use for drag-and-drop zone overlay
- **Existing CSS classes**: Follow current naming conventions
- **Color scheme**: Use existing CSS custom properties

### Design Requirements
- **Consistent styling**: Match existing button styles and colors
- **Responsive design**: Work on mobile/tablet devices
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus indicators
- **Loading states**: Progress indicators for file processing

## 🔗 Integration Specifications

### Current Codebase Integration
- **JavaScript**: Add to existing `docs/script.js` or create new modular file
- **CSS**: Extend `docs/style.css` with new upload-related styles
- **HTML**: Modify `docs/index.html` to include upload interface
- **Event System**: Use existing event patterns for consistency

### Data Flow Output for Phase 2
```javascript
// Event to dispatch when file is ready
const uploadCompleteEvent = new CustomEvent('screenshot-ready', {
  detail: {
    file: File,              // Validated image file
    dimensions: { width: number, height: number },
    metadata: { 
      size: number, 
      type: string, 
      lastModified: number,
      dataUrl: string        // For immediate preview
    }
  }
});
```

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload PNG file via file picker
- [ ] Upload JPG file via file picker  
- [ ] Drag and drop PNG file
- [ ] Drag and drop JPG file
- [ ] Try uploading oversized file (>10MB) - should show error
- [ ] Try uploading invalid file type - should show error
- [ ] Try uploading too small image - should show error
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation to upload button
- [ ] Test with screen reader (if available)
- [ ] Test on mobile device (touch interactions)
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Verify existing cheatsheet functionality still works

### Automated Testing
Create basic tests for:
- File validation logic
- Event dispatching
- Error message display
- UI state management

## 💡 Implementation Guidance

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start Small**: Basic file input + validation
2. **Add Drag & Drop**: Enhance with drag-and-drop functionality
3. **Polish UI**: Integrate styling and animations
4. **Add Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard support
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Manual and automated testing
6. **Document**: Add inline comments for future phases

### Code Organization
```
docs/
├── upload-feature/
│   ├── upload-ui.js           # Main upload interface
│   ├── file-validator.js      # Validation logic
│   ├── upload-styles.css      # Upload-specific styles
│   └── upload-events.js       # Event handling
```

### Integration Pattern
- Extend existing functionality, don't replace
- Use feature detection for progressive enhancement
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing code style and patterns

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Existing Codebase Preservation
- **DO NOT** break existing mod selection functionality
- **DO NOT** change existing CSS class names or IDs
- **DO NOT** modify core cheatsheet logic
- **DO** follow existing naming conventions
- **DO** use existing utility functions where possible

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load upload functionality until needed
- Use efficient file reading methods
- Minimize memory usage during file processing
- Provide feedback for slower operations

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

When you're ready to implement:

1. **Read the required files** listed above
2. **Examine the existing codebase** structure in `/docs/`
3. **Plan your implementation** approach
4. **Start coding** the file upload interface
5. **Test thoroughly** against all success criteria
6. **Prepare integration** for Phase 2 (hex grid mapping)

## 📝 Completion Checklist

Before moving to Phase 2, ensure:
- [ ] All success criteria are met
- [ ] All tests pass (manual and automated)
- [ ] Code is well-documented with comments
- [ ] Integration points are prepared for Phase 2
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (<1s for UI operations)

**When complete, you're ready for Phase 2: Hex Grid Mapping!** 🎉
